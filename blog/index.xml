      <description>3 Sum LeetCode #15 
Description Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

My Thoughts Create a helper function twoSum(nums, target), to find if there are any two elements A and B in nums, A + B = target.</description>

      <description>Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree LeetCode #108 
Description Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST. 
My Thoughts I like to do tree problem recursively if I can. And for this problem, I know I can do it recursively by dividing a big problem into two small problems until I can solve the question.
Because I have to convert array to a height balanced BST, I think that I have to divide the array in the middle everytime.</description>

      <description>Merge Two Binary Trees LeetCode #617 
Description Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node.</description>

      <description>What Happens When Typing URL Into The Browser 
Description What happens when you type www.google.com into the browser? Outline the &amp;ldquo;life of a request&amp;rdquo; from beginning to end.

My Answer High-level outline  Browser check it&amp;rsquo;s cache to see if it has been to that domain name before.
After user typed www.google.com in browser&amp;rsquo;s url bar and clicked enter, browser will check the input with the domain IP pair in it&amp;rsquo;s cache.</description>

      <description>How Many Combination Results 
Description Given an array of numbers, put [+, -, *, /] randomly between every two numbers. Compute and list all possible results.

My Thoughts I think I can do it both iteratively and recursively. If I want to do it iteratively, then I need a stack or a queue. While I do it recursively, then I just have to push result into array when I finish computing last number.</description>

      <description>Trapping Rain Water LeetCode #42 
Description Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
For example,  Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.
My Thoughts I would like to do this problem with two pointers, one points to left wall and another to right wall. If I can find out left and right wall for every part that can trap water, then I can easily compute total water I can get.</description>
